# Python Package | Cookiecutter Project Template

*Cookiecutter template for a Python package.*

This [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template is a fork of the excellent [Cookiecutter-PyPackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage) project template - adapted for Cisco SE use by licensing the generated project under the [Cisco Sample Code License](./LICENSE).

## Motivation

Starting a new Python Package project, with all the usual bells and whistles, involves a lot of boilerplate code and documentation starters that only vary based on a few input parameters:  project name, slug, usernames, etc.  [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) makes generating these boilerplate files a breeze.

## Quickstart

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher):

```bash
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

If you need a bit more help than that, see [Installation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) in the Cookiecutter docs.

### Using the PyPackage Template

#### The First Time

```bash
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/CiscoSE/cc-pypackage
```

...or using abbreviated syntax:

```bash
$ cookiecutter gh:CiscoSE/cc-pypackage
```

#### Thereafter

```bash
$ cookiecutter cc-pypackage
```

## Looking for more Information?

Please see the [PyPackage Tutorial](https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) for the original PyPackage template.  If you have questions about using the Cookiecutter tool itself, please see the [Cookiecutter docs](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io).
